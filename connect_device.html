Purpose of FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE Permission
Our app uses this permission to run a foreground service that communicates with a connected POS (Point of Sale) device for printing receipts or transaction data.
This ensures uninterrupted communication with the connected device even if the app is in the background or the screen is turned off.
The app does not collect or transmit any user personal data as part of this process.
