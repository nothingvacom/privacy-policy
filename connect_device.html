  <h1>VACOM POS - Foreground Service Permission Justification</h1>
  <p>
    This document provides the justification for the foreground service permissions required by the VACOM POS application. The app is deployed on dedicated Android-based POS devices with integrated, internal Bluetooth printers. Its key functionality is to run a persistent foreground service that listens for print commands over a specified local IP port.
  </p>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. <code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE</code></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong> To maintain a stable, persistent connection with the internal Bluetooth printer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures that the foreground service managing the Bluetooth connection remains active even if the app is moved to the background or killed.</li>
      <li>Guarantees real-time printing of invoices and receipts by keeping the printer connection reliable and continuous.</li>
      <li>The printer is an internal device on the POS hardware, and the connection is never exposed to external networks.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. <code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC</code></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable continuous data synchronization by keeping an open socket server active.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Listens on a pre-defined local IP port (e.g., <code>15682</code>) to receive printing commands from other devices in the same local area network (LAN).</li>
      <li>Ensures that the service remains active at all times to process data for print jobs even when the app is not in the foreground.</li>
      <li>Facilitates secure, real-time data transfer strictly within the local network, with no external sharing of data.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>
      VACOM POS is designed exclusively for dedicated POS hardware. The foreground service is critical for delivering uninterrupted printing functionality, especially on devices that require the service to run continuouslyâ€”even when the app UI is closed.
