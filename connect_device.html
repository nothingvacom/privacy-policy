Purpose of FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE and FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC Permissions
Our app uses the FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE permission to run a foreground service that communicates with a connected POS (Point of Sale) device for printing receipts or transaction data.
Additionally, the FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC permission is used to run a foreground service that synchronizes sales and order data between the POS device and our backend server.
These foreground services ensure stable and uninterrupted operations even when the app is running in the background or the device screen is turned off.
The app does not collect, transmit, or share any personal user data as part of these processes.
